![Intellect Devourer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30831/57/1000/1000/638063804285013333.png)
An intellect devourer resembles a walking brain protected by a crusty covering and set on bestial clawed legs. This foul aberration feeds on the intelligence of sentient creatures, taking over a victim’s body on behalf of its [[mind flayer]] masters.

_**Illithid Creations.**_ [[Mind flayer|Mind flayers]] breed intellect devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the Underdark, creating an intellect devourer by taking the brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator as twisted and evil as its masters.

**_Deadly Puppet Masters._** An intellect devourer consumes a creature’s mind and memories, then turns the host body into a puppet under its control. An intellect devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others into the domain of the mind flayers to be enthralled or consumed.
