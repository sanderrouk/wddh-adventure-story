#### Overview:

The Skewered Dragon is a seedy and infamous tavern located in the [[Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. Known for its rough clientele and dubious dealings, the tavern serves as a gathering place for sailors, mercenaries, and various unsavory characters. Despite its reputation, the Skewered Dragon is a key location for adventurers seeking information, employment, or simply a place to lie low.

#### Description:

The exterior of the Skewered Dragon is as uninviting as its reputation suggests. The weathered wooden sign hanging above the entrance depicts a dragon skewered by a massive spear, a sight that often deters the faint-hearted. The building itself is old and worn, with cracked windows and a creaky door that seems to groan in protest every time it is opened.

Inside, the tavern is dimly lit, with a smoky haze perpetually hanging in the air. The rough wooden tables and chairs are mismatched, and the floor is covered with sawdust to soak up the inevitable spills and other messes. The bar, made of dark, heavy wood, is usually occupied by a mix of grizzled regulars and wary newcomers. A small stage in the corner occasionally hosts musicians, though their performances are often drowned out by the boisterous conversations and frequent brawls.

#### Notable Features:

- **Shadowy Corners:** The Skewered Dragon is filled with dark alcoves and secluded corners, perfect for secret meetings and shady deals. Adventurers often find these spots ideal for discussing plans away from prying eyes.
- **The Back Room:** A private room at the back of the tavern, accessible only to those in the know, serves as a meeting place for more clandestine activities. Rumor has it that several major heists and smuggling operations were planned within these walls.
- **The Notice Board:** Near the entrance, a battered notice board is covered with job postings, bounties, and various advertisements. Adventurers looking for work often start here, sifting through the myriad of opportunities.

#### Regular Patrons:

- **Sailors and Dockworkers:** The tavern's proximity to the docks makes it a popular haunt for those working the ships and warehouses. These patrons are a rough-and-tumble lot, quick to anger but also quick to share tales of distant lands and hidden treasures.
- **Zhentarim Agents:** Members of the [[Zhentarim]] often use the Skewered Dragon as a base of operations, conducting their business under the guise of ordinary tavern-goers.
- **Adventurers and Mercenaries:** The Skewered Dragon is a common stop for adventurers seeking information or looking to hire muscle for dangerous jobs.
