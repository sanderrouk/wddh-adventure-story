>Ah, Trollskull Manor, now that's a name with a tale, if my foggy mind recalls correctly. You see, long ago, in the heart of Waterdeep, there was a fearsome troll that terrorized the North Ward. A nasty brute, it was, with a temper as foul as a necromancer's potion gone wrong. The local adventurers, brave or foolish, decided to put an end to its reign of terror.

They tracked the beast to a decrepit mansion, a grand but forgotten structure that had seen better days. After a fierce battle, they managed to slay the troll, and as a trophy, they mounted its skull above the manor’s grand entrance. From that day on, the place was known as Trollskull Manor, a reminder of the victory over the beast and a warning to other creatures that might think of causing trouble.

The manor has changed hands many times since, housing taverns, guilds, and all manner of folk, but the name remains—a testament to that long-ago triumph. Or so the story goes... Mind you, it's been centuries since I've heard it, and my memory isn't what it used to be...
