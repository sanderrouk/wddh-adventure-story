In a shocking turn of events, the cost of coach travel within Waterdeep has skyrocketed, leaving both locals and visitors flabbergasted. An investigative report by The Daily Dragon reveals that prices have been hiked ludicrously high, with many unsuspecting passengers falling victim to ruthless scalping.

"I was just trying to get to the Market," complained Larissa Moonsong, a local artisan. "They charged me 15 dragoons for a short trip! It's madness. I can buy a week's worth of groceries for that!"

Our intrepid journalist, Elyon Quickquill, uncovered a mysterious new guild, the Golden Wheel, rumored to be behind this nefarious price gouging. The Golden Wheel, newly formed and shrouded in secrecy, appear to have monopolized the coach services, hiking prices at will. "The Golden Wheel operates within the bounds of the law, providing premium services to those who seek them," claimed the guild's head, Thaddeus Goldmane, with a sly smile. "Any accusations of unfair pricing are baseless. If anyone has additional inquires, they can talk to my lawyer." The lawyer in question, a rather formidable Half-Orc enforcer, was regrettably unavailable for an interview, primarily because our journalists have a strong preference for keeping all their limbs intact.

Travelers across the city have shared tales of being hustled for exorbitant fares. "A ride that used to cost 3 dragoons now costs 10," fumed Rurik Stonefist, a frequent commuter. "It's daylight robbery!" Meanwhile, a street bard, Lyra Silversong, added, "I used to sing for my supper, now I have to sing to afford a ride home!"

The city officials are yet to comment on these developments, leaving the citizens of Waterdeep in a state of frustration and bewilderment. Will the Golden Wheel be reined in? Only time will tell. For now, travelers beware: hold tight to your coin purses and watch out for those golden coachesâ€”they might just carry you away into the depths of debt.
