[[Waterdeep]]'s evening calm was shattered yesterday as numerous residents reported an alarming sight: a [[manticore]] soaring above the city's rooftops, hurling profanities into the wind while clutching its arm in apparent distress.

"I was just locking up my shop when I heard this guttural yelling," recounted Eliza Portnoy, a shopkeeper in the [[North Ward]]. "I looked up and saw a massive shape blocking out the starsâ€”a [[manticore]]! It was roaring curses I didn't even know existed."

Similar accounts have poured in from the [[Dock Ward]] to the [[Castle Ward]]. Witnesses describe the creature as agitated, its flight erratic as it clutched at its forelimb. Some speculate it may have been injured or under the influence of a spell gone awry.

Captain Alara Swiftwind of the City Guard commented, "We've received multiple reports and are coordinating with the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors to assess any potential threats. Citizens should remain indoors after dark until we have more information."

Archmage Talandra Ravenglow added, "The timing of this sighting is peculiar, coinciding with the recent bouts of confusion affecting our populace. While we cannot confirm any direct connection, we urge everyone to exercise caution."

The city's taverns are abuzz with theories. Some believe the [[manticore]]'s sudden appearance is linked to the arcane anomalies disrupting daily life. Others think it may be a harbinger of further troubles to come.

"I've lived here for decades and never seen the like," said Garrick Stonesmith, a local blacksmith. "First, our minds play tricks on us, and now monsters are flying overhead cursing like sailors. What's next?"

**A Reminder About Manticores**

For those unfamiliar, manticores are fearsome creatures with the body of a lion, the wings of a dragon or bat, and a tail tipped with venomous spines. They possess a rudimentary intelligence and the ability to speak, often in foul tongues. Known for their viciousness and cunning, manticores are apex predators that delight in tormenting their prey before delivering a lethal blow. They typically inhabit remote wilderness areas, making their presence over a bustling city like [[Waterdeep]] both unusual and concerning.
