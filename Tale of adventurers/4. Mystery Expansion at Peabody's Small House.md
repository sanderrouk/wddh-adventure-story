In an unusual turn of events, the Peabody family, owners of the renowned Peabody's Small House, were greeted by an unexpected surprise last week. The family, known for their beloved establishment in the Trades Ward, discovered a group of workers emerging from their cellar, claiming to be from the Constructors Guild. The workers announced they had completed an expansion of the basement—a project the Peabodys had not commissioned.

“We were in the middle of lunch when these folks just popped out of the cellar,” said Lila Peabody, matriarch of the family. “They said they’d finished the job we ordered, but we never asked for any work to be done.” Despite their initial bewilderment, the Peabodys soon found that their previously modest cellar had been transformed into a spacious and well-crafted basement, an expansion they had been contemplating for their growing business.

Curious and cautious, the Peabodys visited the Constructors Guild to verify the workers' claims. To their surprise, the guild had no record of such a job being assigned to their crew. Guildmaster Varric Stonehand expressed his own puzzlement, stating, “We have no record of sending anyone to Peabody’s Small House. This is highly irregular, but we’re glad to see the Peabodys are pleased with the work.” The guild also firmly denied any involvement with the dead bodies discovered in the newly expanded basement, adding another layer of mystery to the incident.

Despite the mystery surrounding the unexpected renovation and the unsettling discovery, the Peabodys decided to honor the effort and craftsmanship put into the expansion. A formal handover ceremony was held, during which the Peabody family presented the guild with a generous sum of dragons in appreciation for the unexpected but much-needed improvement. The guild accepted the dragons graciously, further strengthening the bonds between the local business and the guild. The Peabodys are now looking forward to utilizing the expanded space to enhance their services and better serve their loyal patrons, and are welcoming
