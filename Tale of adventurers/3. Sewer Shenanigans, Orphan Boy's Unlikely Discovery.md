In a turn of events that could only happen in Waterdeep, young orphan Timmy Trettlefoot made a most unusual discovery while playing near the city sewers yesterday. Timmy, a fixture in the Dock Ward known for his mischievous smile and knack for finding odd treasures, stumbled upon a dead Gazer with an arrow sticking out of its main eye and two skeletons, one human and one dwarf, with all their gear intact, washed out from the city's underground labyrinth. 

"I was just looking for something shiny," Timmy explained, holding up a rusty sword almost as tall as he is. "But then this floaty eyeball thing with an arrow in its eye and these bony guys came out of the sewer! I thought I was in trouble, but they were already, y'know, dead and all." The Gazer, a small, round aberration with multiple eye stalks, floated lifelessly, while the two skeletons, clad in mismatched armor, lay in a rather undignified heap beside it.  

The City Watch, alerted by Timmy’s excited shouts, arrived swiftly on the scene. Sergeant Davril Hobb chuckled as he recounted the event. "We’ve had our share of bizarre happenings in Waterdeep, but this takes the cake. The boy’s a local hero now, and the lads at the Watch have taken to calling him 'Skeleton Wrangler.' We’re still figuring out how these remains ended up in the sewers, but it looks like a failed adventuring party. Probably got lost down there, poor souls. As for the arrow in the Gazer's eye, it's anyone's guess how that happened."

As for the Gazer, it has been adopted as an unofficial mascot by the local tavern, The Yawning Portal. Mounted above the bar with the arrow still comically lodged in its main eye, the Gazer has become a quirky fixture. "We’re calling him ‘Winky,’” said Durnan, the tavern’s proprietor, with a grin. “Never thought I’d see the day when a dead Gazer became part of the decor, but here we are. Winky's a real conversation starter and adds a bit of flair to the place!" Ever the entrepreneur, Durnan keeps Winky covered with a cloth and charges a small fee for patrons to lift the cloth and have a look at the unusual trophy, adding an extra bit of fun to the tavern’s bustling atmosphere.

Timmy Trettlefoot, basking in his newfound fame, has been enjoying the perks of his discovery, including free meals at the tavern and promises of new adventures. “Maybe next time I’ll find a dragon egg!” he declared, much to the amusement of the gathered crowd. In a city as magical and unpredictable as Waterdeep, one can never be too sure what surprises the day will bring.
