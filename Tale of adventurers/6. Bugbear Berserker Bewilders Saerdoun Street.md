[[Waterdeep]]'s Saerdoun Street was thrown into a chaotic uproar yesterday noon as a particularly agitated [[bugbear]] tore through the bustling avenue, screaming, "There's two of him!" in a tone that could curdle fresh milk. Witnesses report the [[bugbear]], unidentified, charged down the cobblestones in a panicked rage, swatting at invisible foes and leaving a trail of devastation in his wake. The scene was one of utter bedlam as he bowled over merchants' stalls, sent a fruit cart flying, and barreled into the front door of Frewn's Brews, much to the dismay of its patrons.

The local businesses bore the brunt of the [[bugbear]]'s rampage. Corellon's Crown, a beloved herbalist shop, now boasts a new skylight courtesy of the ravager's hasty exit through the roof. Meanwhile, Steam and Steel had its morning productivity interrupted when the culprit decided to use the forge's bellows as a makeshift weapon against his unseen pursuer. "He just kept shouting about 'him' being everywhere," said a bewildered blacksmith, covered in soot and clutching what remained of a shattered hammer. "I've never seen a [[bugbear]] so confused in my life."

[[City Watch]] officers tried to subdue the frantic [[bugbear]] with the help of a particularly brave street bard who distracted him with a hastily composed song about the dangers of hallucinations and too much goblin ale. Despite their best efforts, the culprit managed to slip through their grasp, disappearing into the labyrinthine alleyways of [[Waterdeep]].

While the precise cause of the [[bugbear]]'s panic remains unclear, rumor has it that a mischievous illusionist may have had a hand in the [[bugbear]]'s bizarre behavior. Regardless, the citizens of [[Trollskull Alley]] are left to pick up the pieces and share the tale of the day their neighborhood hosted an impromptu [[bugbear]] ballet.
