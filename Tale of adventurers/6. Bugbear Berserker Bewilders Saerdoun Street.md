Waterdeep's Saerdoun Street was thrown into a chaotic uproar yesterday noon as a particularly agitated bugbear tore through the bustling avenue, screaming, "There's two of him!" in a tone that could curdle fresh milk. Witnesses report the bugbear, unidentified, charged down the cobblestones in a panicked rage, swatting at invisible foes and leaving a trail of devastation in his wake. The scene was one of utter bedlam as he bowled over merchants' stalls, sent a fruit cart flying, and barreled into the front door of The Spotted Griffin Inn, much to the dismay of its patrons.

The local businesses bore the brunt of the bugbear's rampage. Madam Whisker's Apothecary, a staple of Saerdoun Street known for its exotic potions, now boasts a new skylight courtesy of the ravager's hasty exit through the roof. Meanwhile, The Iron Anvil Smithy had its morning productivity interrupted when the culprit decided to use the forge's bellows as a makeshift weapon against his unseen pursuer. "He just kept shouting about 'him' being everywhere," said a bewildered blacksmith, covered in soot and clutching what remained of a shattered hammer. "I've never seen a bugbear so confused in my life."

City Watch officers tried to subdue the frantic bugbear with the help of a particularly brave street bard who distracted him with a hastily composed song about the dangers of hallucinations and too much goblin ale. Despite their best efforts, the culprit managed to slip through their grasp, disappearing into the labyrinthine alleyways of Waterdeep. 

While the precise cause of the bugbear's panic remains unclear, rumor has it that a mischievous illusionist may have had a hand in the bugbear's bizarre behavior. Regardless, the citizens of Waterdeep are left to pick up the pieces and share the tale of the day Saerdoun Street hosted an impromptu bugbear ballet.
