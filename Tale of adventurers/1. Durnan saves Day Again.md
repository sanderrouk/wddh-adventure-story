![[Durnan saves day again.webp]]
Last night at the [[The Yawning Portal|Yawning Portal Inn]] was an evening to remember. The atmosphere was electric, filled with the buzz of adventurers readying themselves for journeys into the [[Undermountain]]. The clamor of conversation and the clinking of tankards created a lively backdrop to the night's activities. Patrons exchanged tales of past exploits, while hopeful adventurers prepared for their descent into the famed portal, seeking glory and treasure.

The festivities, however, came to an abrupt halt when a blood-curdling roar echoed through the tavern. Emerging from the depths of the portal was a horrific sightâ€”a massive [[Troll|troll]], its grotesque form covered in grime and remnants of unfortunate adventurers still clinging to its maw. The beast's monstrous frame was further adorned with stirges, their bat-like wings flapping as they fed off the troll's blood.

Chaos erupted as patrons scrambled for safety. Amid the panic, [[Durnan]], the barkeep and owner of the Yawning Portal, leapt over the bar with remarkable agility. Known for his formidable skills and bravery, [[Durnan]] quickly engaged the troll, wielding his greatsword with precision and strength.

As the battle raged, four mysterious adventurers rose to the occasion, joining [[Durnan]] in the fight against the monstrous intruder. These brave souls, cloaked in shadow and secrecy, displayed extraordinary prowess. Their swift and coordinated attacks hinted at their seasoned expertise, though their identities remain unknown to the tavern's patrons.

The clash between [[Durnan]], the adventurers, and the troll was a sight to behold. Sparks flew as swords clashed, and the air was thick with the scent of battle. The troll's roars of fury were matched by the determined cries of its opponents. After a fierce struggle, the troll was finally defeated, its massive form collapsing back into the pit from whence it came.

As the dust settled and the tavern slowly returned to normalcy, whispers filled the air. Who were these enigmatic heroes who had fought alongside [[Durnan]]? Will they return to the Yawning Portal, or were they merely passing through on their own quests? Only time will tell if these mysterious adventurers will make another appearance.

For now, [[The Yawning Portal|the Yawning Portal Inn]] remains safe, thanks to the quick actions of [[Durnan]] and the courage of the four unknown warriors. The tale of their bravery will undoubtedly be recounted for many nights to come, adding yet another legendary chapter to the storied history of the [[The Yawning Portal|Yawning Portal.]]
