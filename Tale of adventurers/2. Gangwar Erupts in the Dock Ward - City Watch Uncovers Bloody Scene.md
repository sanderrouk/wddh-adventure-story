![[Gangwar erupts in the Dock Ward.webp]]
Last night was a tumultuous one in the [[Dock Ward]] as the [[City Watch]], led by [[Hyustus Staget|Captain Hyustus Staget]], was kept on their toes. Responding to a tip-off about suspicious activities, the Watch was investigating a warehouse believed to be linked to the [[Zhentarim]]. What they found instead was a scene of carnage that has sent shockwaves through [[Waterdeep]].

The warehouse, dimly lit and reeking of blood, was littered with the bodies of both [[Zhentarim]] and [[Xanathar Guild]] members. Signs of a brutal confrontation were evident, with overturned crates, broken weapons, and splatters of blood painting a grim picture of the violent clash. The discovery of this deadly skirmish between the rival factions has heightened tensions in the [[Dock Ward]], an area already known for its perilous streets and shadowy dealings.

Amidst the chaos, a few remaining suspects were apprehended by the[[ City Watch]]. These individuals, found lurking near the scene, are believed to have information about the deadly encounter. Their testimonies could prove crucial in unraveling the events that led to this bloody mess.

Eyewitnesses have come forward with accounts that add another layer of intrigue to the unfolding drama. Several witnesses claim to have seen four suspicious characters near the warehouse before and during the commotion. These descriptions bear a striking resemblance to the four enigmatic adventurers who recently aided [[Durnan]] in repelling a [[troll]] attack at [[the Yawning Portal]] Inn. The identities and allegiances of these figures remain unknown, leaving [[Waterdeep]]'s citizens to wonder: are these mysterious individuals friends or foes?

[[Hyustus Staget|Captain Staget]], ever the vigilant protector of the city's laws, has issued a stern reminder to all citizens to abide by [[The Code Legal]]. "In these times of uncertainty and unrest, it is imperative that we adhere to the laws that keep our city safe and just. The [[City Watch]] will continue to uphold these principles and bring those who break them to justice," he declared.

As the investigation continues, the [[Dock Ward]] remains under close scrutiny. The [[City Watch]] is determined to piece together the events that led to this violent altercation and to prevent further bloodshed. The question of whether the four unknown adventurers are involved, and whether they pose a threat or stand as potential allies, lingers in the minds of many.

For now, [[Waterdeep]] holds its breath, waiting for answers and hoping for peace in the midst of chaos.
