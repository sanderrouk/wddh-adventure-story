#### Elf and Half-Elf Sailors Targeted

[[Waterdeep]]'s [[Dock Ward]] is gripped by fear as a series of brutal murders have left the community on edge. In recent weeks, three elf and half-elf sailors have been found decapitated, their bodies discovered in the dead of night. The gruesome nature of these crimes has shocked residents and raised concerns about safety in the city's bustling harbor district.

The killings all bear the same chilling hallmark: each victim was decapitated by a blade, indicating the work of a skilled and ruthless killer. The [[Dock Ward]], usually a hub of activity and trade, now harbors an air of unease as sailors and dockworkers remain vigilant, wary of becoming the next target.

The [[City Watch]], led by Captain [[Hyustus Staget]], is actively investigating the murders, but so far, no leads have emerged. The lack of witnesses and the precision of the attacks suggest a calculated and elusive perpetrator. As the sun sets over [[Waterdeep]], the question on everyone's mind remains: who is behind these heinous acts, and why are they targeting elf and half-elf sailors?

The community has rallied together, sharing information and increasing patrols in hopes of deterring further violence. Despite these efforts, the fear persists, casting a shadow over the [[Dock Ward]]'s daily routines. Residents are urged to remain cautious, avoid traveling alone at night, and report any suspicious activity to the [[City Watch]].

As the investigation continues, the people of [[Waterdeep]] hope that justice will soon be served, bringing an end to the reign of terror that has struck at the heart of their harbor.
