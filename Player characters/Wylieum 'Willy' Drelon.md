### Character Background: Wylieum Drelon

#### Early Life
Wylieum Drelon was born into the illustrious Drelon family, renowned for their wealth and influence among the elven aristocracy. Raised in the serene and majestic city of Evereska, Willy's childhood was one of privilege and comfort, surrounded by the finest luxuries elven culture had to offer. His parents, Lord Thalion and Lady Aranel Drelon, were respected scholars and collectors of ancient texts, their vast library a testament to their intellectual pursuits.

#### Tragedy Strikes
Willy's life took a devastating turn on the eve of his 112th birthday. Returning home from a celebratory outing, he discovered a horrifying scene: his parents had been brutally murdered, their lifeless bodies lying in pools of blood. The once vibrant Shadowdawn estate was now a place of death and despair.

In his grief and desperation, Willy remembered the forbidden room in their library, a place his parents had always warned him never to enter. Ignoring their past admonitions, he ventured into the shadowy depths of the room, drawn to a large, ominous tome bound in black leather—a book of necromancy.

#### The Forbidden Act
Fueled by sorrow and a desire to undo the horror that had befallen his family, Willy performed a resurrection ritual from the necromantic book. The dark magic, however, was beyond his understanding and control. Instead of bringing his mother back to life, he created an abomination—a zombie, a twisted parody of the woman who had raised him with love and care. Horrified by what he had done, Willy was forced to destroy the creature that was once his mother, a second and more heart-wrenching loss.

#### The Endless Search
Haunted by his failure and the image of his mother's undead form, Willy swore to master the dark arts in hopes of finding a way to truly bring his parents back to life. He abandoned his ancestral home, embarking on a quest for forbidden knowledge. His journey took him through ancient ruins, dark forests, and hidden catacombs, where he delved deeper into the secrets of necromancy. As decades turned into centuries, Willy's pursuit became an obsession, his once noble spirit gradually eroded by the dark powers he sought to command.

#### Arrival in Waterdeep
After centuries of wandering, Willy's quest brought him to [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors. [[Waterdeep]], with its vast resources and myriad of arcane scholars, offered new opportunities for Willy to continue his studies. He joined the Wizards' Guild, where his extensive knowledge and unique talents earned him a place of respect, albeit tinged with the fear and suspicion his necromantic focus attracted.

#### A Life Extended
In Waterdeep, Willy remained for centuries, his elven lifespan allowing him to accumulate vast knowledge and power. His time with the Wizards' Guild granted him access to rare tomes and powerful artifacts, yet the secret to true resurrection continued to elude him. As the years passed, Willy's once vibrant appearance faded, replaced by a gaunt, ethereal presence that spoke of his prolonged exposure to dark magic.

#### Current State
Now, at the age of 704, Willy is a figure of mystery and dread within [[Waterdeep]]. Though he has found a semblance of stability within the Wizards' Guild, his quest is far from over. He continues to search tirelessly for a way to undo the tragedy that has defined his life, driven by a desperate hope that one day, he might finally lay his parents' souls to rest and find peace for himself.
