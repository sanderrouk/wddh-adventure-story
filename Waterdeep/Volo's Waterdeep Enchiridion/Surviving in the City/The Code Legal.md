[[Waterdeep]] is no village led by hidebound hierarchs or petty fiefdom ruled by the whim of a warlord. It is a city of laws moulded by Tyr’s spirit of justice. As a rule, you can trust members of the [[City Watch]] to do their duty diligently, and you can expect that the city’s magisters will be fair. If you have cause to come before the Masked Lords or the Open Lord herself, rest assured that if your cause be just, justice will be done. If, however, you find yourself in the wrong, know that though it might take time to weigh that wrong on Tyr’s scales, his hammer will fall — and it will be wielded by [[Waterdeep]] with a vengeance.

Unlike in less civilized settlements, punishment for crimes in [[Waterdeep]] isn’t typically used as public entertainment. Scheduled executions occur behind the high walls of Castle [[Waterdeep]], and floggings are carried out in the watch post nearest the sentencing. The Watch makes every effort to take individuals into custody quietly, so as not to disrupt other citizens. Those bystanders generally return the favor by giving altercations between criminals and the Watch a wide berth.

[[Waterdeep]] has a complex library of law and custom set by precedent, the main body of which can be read in the Code Legal. This document is available in multiple languages at the Palace of [[Waterdeep]], and (in the Common tongue) provided on request by the magisters at the gates and in the harbor. Be aware that the Code Legal provides only an outline of typical sentences for various offenses, and magisters have broad discretion when meting out justice as they see fit. Any Masked Lord can overturn a magister’s ruling, but there’s rarely a Masked Lord around when you need one.
