The Zhentarim, (pronounced: /zzˈhɛntɑːrɪm/ zz-HENT-ah-rim) previously known as the Black Network, was a mercenary company, and greater mercantile organization in Faerûn, who, over their 200 years of existence, has had a storied history as a cadre of self-serving thieves, spies, assassins and malevolent wizards, who for a time, were indentured by their leaders to serve dark gods Bane and Cyric. Over the decades, the organization experienced several leaps and bounds in terms of successes, but also major misfortune, particularly for their historical strongholds around the Moonsea. 

The Black Network has an open recruitment policy. Anyone can join. Tenacity and loyalty are highly valued (but not essential) traits in new members.

The Zhentarim is a shadow organization that trades mercenaries and goods (including weapons) for profit. It has long sought to gain political influence in Waterdeep, but the strength of the city’s Masked Lords, nobility, and professional guilds makes that difficult.

The Zhentarim in [[Waterdeep]] is a fractured organization. Those who support [[Manshoon]] want to destroy [[Xanathar Guild]] and seize political and economic control of the city. Those who oppose [[Manshoon]] want to expose and destroy him before they are themselves apprehended or driven out of the city by the local authorities.
