Captain Staget is an uptight man who helps keep the peace in the [[Dock Ward]]. Every shopkeeper, guild member, innkeeper, and tavern keeper in the [[Dock Ward]] knows him, and most respect him regardless of their opinions of the [[City Watch]] in general. Staget doesn’t believe in rumors or gossip, he doesn’t drink, and he doesn’t let anger get the better of him. His job is to curb the violence in the [[Dock Ward]], but he has been dragging his heels. After all, he reasons, if the[[ Xanathar Guild]] and the [[Zhentarim]] want to destroy each other, why not let them?
