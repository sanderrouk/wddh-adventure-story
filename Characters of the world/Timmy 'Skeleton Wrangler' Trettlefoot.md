Timmy Trettlefoot, a scrappy and spirited orphan, has been a familiar face in the [[Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] for as long as the locals can remember. Born to a pair of transient adventurers who disappeared into the [[Undermountain]] never to return, Timmy learned early on to fend for himself in the bustling streets of the city.

Despite his circumstances, Timmy’s infectious smile and boundless curiosity endeared him to many. Known for his knack for finding the oddest treasures amidst the refuse and detritus of [[Waterdeep]]’s streets, he quickly earned a reputation as the [[Dock Ward]]’s little scavenger with a heart of gold. Whether it was a lost coin purse, a shiny trinket, or an unusual relic, Timmy had an uncanny ability to uncover hidden gems where others saw only trash.

His latest escapade, however, would catapult him from a mere street urchin to a local hero. While playing near the sewers, a favorite haunt for the adventurous youngster, Timmy stumbled upon a scene straight out of an adventurer's tale. The sight of a dead [[Gazer]], an aberrant creature with a central eye and multiple stalks, caught his eye. Even more astonishing were the two skeletons—a human and a dwarf—washed out from the labyrinthine depths beneath [[Waterdeep]]. The human skeleton still clutched a rusty sword, almost as tall as Timmy himself, and both sets of remains were clad in mismatched armor, a testament to their unfortunate end.

Timmy’s discovery was nothing short of sensational. His excited shouts brought the [[City Watch]] rushing to the scene, where Captain [[Hyustus Staget]] himself couldn’t help but chuckle at the boy’s extraordinary find. Dubbed the “Skeleton Wrangler” by the watchmen, Timmy reveled in the attention and admiration that followed.

The [[Gazer]], with an arrow lodged comically in its central eye, was adopted by the local tavern, [[The Mermaids Arms]], and turned into a quirky mascot affectionately named "Winky." This unusual trophy now hangs above the bar, becoming a favorite attraction for patrons eager to hear the story of its discovery.

Timmy’s life has changed dramatically since that fateful day. The [[Dock Ward]]’s little scavenger now enjoys free meals at [[The Mermaids Arms]] and dreams of future adventures. With his newfound fame, Timmy remains ever-optimistic, declaring to anyone who would listen that his next find might be even more incredible—perhaps a dragon egg, he muses with a mischievous glint in his eye.

In a city as magical and unpredictable as [[Waterdeep]], young Timmy Trettlefoot embodies the spirit of adventure and wonder. His tale is a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, heroes can be found, and extraordinary discoveries await those with the heart and courage to seek them.
